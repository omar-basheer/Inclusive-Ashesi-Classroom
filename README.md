# Inclusive-Ashesi-Classroom
This project seeks to establish a base level of inclusiveness for future/current students of Ashesi University, specifically those with Dyslexia. This Dyslexic Student Support System will be a specialized component made just for dyslexic students. This module will be designed to facilitate easy access to course materials while ensuring they are presented in a way that meets each student's individual learning needs. Through the implementation of a system that incorporates these subsystems, the project hopes to enhance the educational experience of students in Ashesi with dyslexia.



## Technologies and Justification
### 1. Django Framework
- Django is a popular Python-based framework that is normally used for building web applications. It provides pre-built components and conventions, which simplifies the web app development process and allows developers to focus on writing their application’s specific logic rather than dealing with repetitive tasks. Basically, it’s all about reusability. 
The decision to employ the Django framework in this system is justified by its high-level built-in features for development. An example is Django's inbuilt tokens enhance user authentication, providing a secure and efficient way to manage user access and interactions within the system.
Also, in terms of scalability, this framework also can handle increasing workload efficiently distributing resources. Django's built-in security measures are crucial for handling sensitive dyslexia-related information, and its database abstraction simplifies data management. The framework's versatility for front-end integration, coupled with a customizable admin interface, ensures a modern and user-friendly experience.


### 2. React
- Selecting React as the frontend framework for the Ashesi University Dyslexia Screening and Student Support System is justified by its ability to create dynamic, responsive, and interactive user interfaces, essential for delivering an inclusive learning experience. React's component-based architecture aligns well with the modular nature of the Dyslexia Screening and Student Support System, allowing for the seamless integration of distinct components. This ensures the development of a user interface that caters to the unique needs of dyslexic students, providing a customizable and adaptive learning environment. React's virtual DOM enhances performance, crucial for rendering content promptly and facilitating easy navigation. Moreover, the extensive React community and the availability of numerous libraries and tools contribute to the overall efficiency and maintainability of the project.

### 3. Microsft Azure
- Microsoft Azure, a prominent public cloud computing platform, stands as the backbone for our innovative project — an Inclusive Classroom app designed specifically for students with dyslexia. Azure's distinguished features include exceptional availability and robust security, meeting and exceeding the highest industry requirements and standards.
In the realm of inclusive education, our app utilizes Azure's capabilities to enable swift and straightforward deployment, ensuring that educators, students, and administrators can access the platform seamlessly from any location. This accessibility is crucial for fostering an inclusive learning environment that transcends geographical boundaries.
Additionally, Azure's comprehensive services play a pivotal role in the app's functionality by providing essential tools for data backup and recovery. This ensures the integrity and resilience of the platform, safeguarding critical educational content and facilitating a reliable and efficient operational ecosystem for students with dyslexia and their educators.
